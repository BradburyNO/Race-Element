# Download and Installation
1. **<a href="https://github.com/RiddleTime/Race-Element/releases/latest" target="_blank">Download</a>** the app. The link will lead you to the latest version at GitHub.  
2. Place **RaceElement.exe** in any folder of My Documents. If the app is not located there you will encounter issues with the auto-updater.
3. Then simply run the app. Do **not** run it as admin, since this will prevent some features from working.

# Guides
The app includes an about tab which contains a guide section, read this carefully since it includes instructions on how to use for example the HUDs.  

There are multiple guides posted on this web page which you can find [here](/guide/).
