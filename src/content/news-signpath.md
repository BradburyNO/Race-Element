# Certificates and trusted sources
Some time ago I have gotten a bit frustrated that the app was not signed with a certificate. At least a certificate that browsers and other security software use to check for legitimate software.
Browsers would keep warning users that the app was probably not secure.
With the app being build and the source being verified each build will be trusted by at least browser.
