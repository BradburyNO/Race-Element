# Race Element
Race Element is a lightweight application that is designed to run with minimum system requirements.

## Supported Simulators
- Assetto Corsa Competizione (ACC)

## Main Features
- HUDs
- Data
- Setups
- Liveries
- Streaming

### HUDs
HUDs(Head-up displays) are 2D graphics that can be used to provide you data during driving. There are a various amount of HUDs that each provides you useful information in a minimalistic manner whilst being highly configurable.

### Data
The app represents data recorded during driving into so called Race Weekend Databases(RWDB files). These Race Weekends can be viewed in the Data tab of the application and provide you essential information such as lap- and sectortimes, fuel usage and the conditions of each lap.

### Setups
Whilst usually one has to start the game to view car setups, the app itself presents them to be viewed and compared in the Setups tab. Additionally you are able to quickly copy them to the clipboard and import them by drag-and-dropping them on top of the app.

### Liveries
The Liveries tab provides functionality to manage liveries. These liveries can be created, browsed, imported, exported and categorized. Race Element provides some highly effecient methods to do so.

### Streaming
During your stream the app provides a smart functionality that is able to automatically enable a Source when you visit the setup screen in-game. This will allow you to present any kind of Source on top of your existing sources to for example hide your setup and/or provide information about your setups.
