# Race Element
Race Element is a lightweight application for sim racing that is designed to run with minimum system requirements. The question I asked myself when trying other HUD applications is: Why are all these apps abusing my cpu, ram and graphics card to a point where the lost performance is enough to buy another step up in graphics cards. That ends now!

### HUDs
HUDs(Head-up displays) are 2D graphics that can be used to provide you data whilst driving. There are a various amount of HUDs that each provides you useful information in a minimalistic manner whilst being highly configurable.
- Scalable
- Modular
- Custom Configuration
- Low performance hit as the app doesn't use your gpu to render the HUDs.
- Can be used for stream only

### Data
The app represents data recorded during driving into so called Race Weekend Databases(RWDB files). These Race Weekends can be viewed in the Data tab of the application and provide you essential information such as lap- and sectortimes, fuel usage and the conditions of each lap.

### Setups

- Browse setups
- Compare setups
- Copy setups to the clipboard or to another track
- Import setups by drag and drop on-top of the app(even works straight from discord)

### Liveries
The Liveries tab provides functionality to manage liveries, Race Element automatically scans the right folders and shows you all your custom liveries.
- Browse the Files and folders of a livery straight from the app
- Create the base for a Custom Livery on the fly, the days of manually setting up a custom livery are gone
- Drag and Drop to Import Livery Archives(.zip, .rar, .7z), either single liveries or livery packs
