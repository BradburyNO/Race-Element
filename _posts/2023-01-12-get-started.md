## How to get started
First of all, **[Download](https://github.com/RiddleTime/Race-Element/releases/latest "Download")** the app. The link will lead you to the latest version at GitHub.

Place **RaceElement.exe** on your boot drive, recommends is to make a folder for it in My Documents. If the app is not located on your boot drive you will encounter issues with the auto-updater.

Then simply run the app. Do **not** run it as admin, since this will prevent some features from working.

## Guides inside the app\'s About Tab
The app includes an about tab which contains a guide section, read this carefully since it includes instructions on how to use for example the HUDs.

There are multiple guides posted on this web page which you can find [here](https://race.elementfuture.com/tag/guide/ "here").

### Help! my browser, windows and my anti-virus tell me this is a dangerous file.
The app is open source, you can always check out the source code to ensure the app is not doing anything that it should not be doing. The reason why this is happening is because the app does not have an [EV Certificate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Validation_Certificate "EV Certificate"), these are fairly expensive($200-$300 a year) and I\'d rather spend resources on actually improving the app.
