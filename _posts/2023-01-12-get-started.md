## How to get started
First of all, **[Download](https://github.com/RiddleTime/Race-Element/releases/latest "Download")** the app. The link will lead you to the latest version at GitHub.

Place **RaceElement.exe** on your boot drive, best practice is to make a folder for it in My Documents. If the app is not located on your boot drive you will encounter issues with the auto-updater.

Then simply run the app. Do **not** run it as admin, since this will prevent some features from working.

## Guides inside the app\'s About Tab
The app includes an about tab which contains a guide section, read this carefully since it includes instructions on how to use for example the HUDs.

There are multiple guides posted on this web page which you can find [here](https://race.elementfuture.com/tag/guide/ "here").
