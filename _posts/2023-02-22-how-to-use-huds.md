The app contains HUDs(Heads up displays)/Overlays, these can be found in the HUD tab. HUDs are 2D graphics that overlay the game.

## Activation
Activated HUDs will show a green marker in the left side HUD list.
You can activate a HUD by:
- Double clicking them in the left side HUD List.
- Clicking the Title of the HUD in the right side panel.
- Right clicking whilst in the right side panel whilst a HUD is shown.

## Visibility
By default the activated HUDs will only become visible once you are driving and the engine of the car is running.
Now if you want to have them showing at any time, you can enable the Always Visible mode, this is a toggle-button on the top-left of the HUD tab.
- Don't see any HUDs? make sure you have activated the ones you want to use. 
- When the game is in Fullscreen mode, tap F11 twice. This will allow other windows to be on top whilst in full screen mode.

## Movement
Activated HUDs can be moved with the mouse by enabling the \'movement mode\'.
You can toggle the movement mode by:
- Keyboard: Control + Home
- Click the movement mode button.
- Clicking your scroll wheel(middle mouse button) in the right side panel.

## Customization
HUDs can be customized using the options in the right side panel.
By default every HUD contains an option to set the Scale, the Opacity, Enabling \'Window mode\' and choosing whether the HUDs should be \'Always On Top\'.
Aside from these default options there are HUD specific options.
