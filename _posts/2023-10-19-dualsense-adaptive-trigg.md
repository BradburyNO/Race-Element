## DualSenseX
A couple of a days ago I came accross an app called DualSenseX(DSX in short).
This app allowed me to send commands to the Playstation 5 controller so the triggers would actually react to braking force, tc and abs.

The functionality to send these commands has been added to Race Element 0.2.4.0
Check out the guide in the discord how to get started and bring the experience with a Dual Sense to another level: https://discord.com/channels/962649775478558811/1164558784119705630
